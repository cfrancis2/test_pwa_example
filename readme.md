# PWA
Sample code through guided workshop for created progressive web applications.  This takes advantage of service workers on the browser
to create fast working and cachable site to check weather.

Some code was provided as a framework.  This was an exercise completed in steps where we had freedom to code, then compare what we did
to the suggested solutions.  Some of my code was updated based on best practices given after the fact.
